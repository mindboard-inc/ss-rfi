Introduction
============

Creating an extensive business plan is unnecessary for most businesses
to get started. However, creating a short business plan offers several
benefits that more than outweigh the investment of time:

-   The process of thinking and writing the plan provides clarity for
    the business.

-   If capital is needed from outside sources, investors want to see a
    plan that demonstrates a solid understanding and vision for the
    business.

-   The plan will help prioritize tasks that are most important.

-   With growth, the plan offers a common understanding of the vision to
    new leaders.

A simple business plan for a start-up service company can be completed
rather quickly. Keeping in mind who the intended audience is, write
simply. The plan needs to be understandable, readable, and realistic.

This template is organized into seven sub-plans or sections to be
completed.

1.  Executive Summary

2.  Company Overview

3.  Business Description

4.  Market Analysis

5.  Operating Plan

6.  Marketing and Sales Plan

7.  Financial Plan

It is recommended to complete the Executive Summary last, after all of
the other sections have been completed. As information is filled in,
from the Company Overview to the Financial Plan, the writing should tell
the story of the motivation and vision behind the business. Be sure to
include what will make the business successful, how success will be
achieved, and how success will be measured.

It is important to keep the business plan updated in order to see
progress, celebrate success, and adjust where issues arise. This is best
done on a quarterly, if not monthly, basis.

Executive Summary
=================

**The Executive Summary should be written last** after the remainder of
the plan has been finished. It is an overview (with a suggested length
of no more than one page) of the business, including the problem the
business aims to solve, why this business' solution is different, the
business' ideal customer, and the expected results. The Executive
Summary should provide a high-level and optimistic description of the
company.

If the business requires outside investment or external investors,
include how much is needed, how it will be used, and how it will make
the business more profitable. Think of this section as the first thing a
potential investor reads, thus, it must capture their interest quickly.

Suggested headings to organize this business plan include the following.

-   **Opportunity:** What problem will the business solve?

-   **Mission:** What problem will the business solve?

-   **Solution:** How will the service uniquely solve the problem
    identified?

-   **Market focus:** What market and ideal customers will the business
    target?

-   **Competitive advantage:** How does the business intend to succeed
    against its competitors?

-   **Ownership:** Who are the major stakeholders in the company?

-   **Expected returns:** What are the key milestones for revenue,
    profits, growth, and customers?

Company Overview
================

The Company Overview is a brief summary of the intended business,
including what it uniquely delivers, the mission, how it got started,
market positioning, operational structure, and financial goals. After
reviewing this section, the reader should have a broad understanding of
what the business is setting out to do and how it is organized.

This section is not meant to be lengthy. Keep it short and succinct.
This is the snapshot of the business. The type of business will
determine what of the following sections will be required for the
business plan. Only include what is needed to properly represent the
business and remove anything else.

-   **Company summary:** This is the introductory section to the
    company, also known as the 'elevator pitch' of what the company
    stands for and is setting out to do. Include the company's goals and
    some of the near-term objectives. Even if it is a small,
    service-oriented company, developing a summary is an important step
    to explain and focus the core business.

-   **Mission statement:** This is a concise statement on the guiding
    principles of the company and what the company aims to do for
    customers, employees, owners, and other stakeholders.

-   **Company history:** This provides the back story, especially the
    personal story, of why the business was founded. Use this section to
    give the overarching history of the company from its start and bring
    the reader up-to-date on where the company is now in terms of sales,
    profits, key services, and customers.

-   **Markets and services:** This outlines the target market and
    related needs that the company will address. Include brief
    descriptions of offered services and targeted markets and customer
    types. This section can be a general overview as more details will
    be suggested in a later section of this plan.

-   **Operational structure:** This describes the operational details of
    the business. List any potential employees needed on the payroll to
    make the business run.

-   **Financial goals:** This describes the start-up capital needed,
    projected revenue and profits, forecast, and budget of the business.

Business Description
====================

This section will first frame the business opportunity and should answer
the question: what problem(s) is the company trying to solve? Use a case
example to describe the customers' pain point and how it is solved
today. If the business' service addresses something the market has yet
to identify as a problem (for instance, a new mobile app or a new
clothing line), then also describe how the business' solution reduces
stress, saves money, or brings joy to the customer.

After framing the opportunity, describe the service in detail and how it
is the solution the business offers, how it solves that problem, and
what benefits customers will receive.

This section also describes in more detail how the services will be
rendered and the pricing structure (e.g., fixed rate versus an hourly
fee). Describe how the company plans to differentiate from its
competitors. What is the target market and how can the customer
capitalize on your unique offering?

Depending on the type of business, the following sections may or may not
be necessary. Only include relevant sections and remove everything else.

-   **Opportunity:** Describe the current market for the business'
    offered service. At a high level, what is the market and who are its
    participants; is it business customers or consumers; what is the
    specific geography, etc.? More details on the market will be
    provided in the next section of the plan. Next, describe the current
    state of available services and how the business will offer better.
    Also discuss any additional services the company plans to offer in
    the future.

-   **Product overview:** Describe the service offerings of the business
    in as much detail as possible. If it is effective to include
    pictures, this would be a good place to place them.

-   **Key participants:** Identify any strategic partners in the
    business, such as critical suppliers, distributors, referral
    partners, or any others. In some businesses, products are
    custom-made and any break in their supply will impact the business.
    There may be key contributors to the services offered, so it is
    important to identify them.

-   **Pricing:** Provide pricing of the service, gross margin projects,
    and upgrade paths. Describe why the company's pricing will be
    attractive to the target market. Have a gauge on the competitor's
    pricing and explain how the business' service is unique to justify
    its pricing structure.

<!-- -->

-   Note the difference between working hours and billable hours. All
    working hours are not billable. If the business has employees with
    differing skill levels (for example, in a law practice, there are
    associates, paralegals, lawyers, partners, etc.), indicate the
    various billing rates.

-   Communicate rates clearly to clients and customers. If there are
    potential additional fees which will be passed on to clients or
    customers, define and establish them up front.

Market Analysis
===============

The Market Analysis provides the reader with an understanding of how
well the business knows and understands its market and if it is big
enough to support the business objectives. This section provides an
overview of the industry that the business will participate in. As this
section is narrowed down to the ideal customer based on the business
strategy, the plan will define the target market. A detailed description
and sizing of the target market will help the reader understand the
market value the business is pursuing (the number of potential customers
multiplied by the average revenue for the product or service).

In defining the target market, the plan will identify key elements such
as geographic location, demographics, buyer characteristics, the target
market\'s needs, and how market needs are currently being met. If there
are any direct competitors, explain how the company's service compares
to the competitors in terms of solving the consumers' problems.

This section may also include a Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities,
and Threats (SWOT) Analysis as necessary, to better assess the business'
position against the competition.

Depending on the type of business, the following sections may or may not
be necessary. Only include what is need and remove everything else.

-   **Industry type:** Begin with the broader descriptions of the market
    opportunity. For instance, if the intended business is a travel
    agency, the industry type would be service industry. In this
    particular market, the global revenues are projected to exceed \$183
    billion, but the local agency will have a much smaller market.
    Identify the potential clientele in the company's local geography
    that might fit into the target demographic group. This section will
    also identify any industry regulations and evaluate trends in market
    growth and stability.

-   **Market segmentation:** This section defines the main market
    segments and those the business is targeting now. A market segment
    is a group of people (or other businesses) within the industry,
    identify smaller segments, such as luxury travel or exotic cruisers.
    The market can also be segmented by criteria such as quality, price,
    range of products, geography, demographics, and others. A few other
    elements to consider answer questions such as: Is the segment
    growing, shrinking, or will it be flat for the next few years? What
    percentage of the market will be reachable? What share of the market
    is anticipated within the next 2-3 years? Graphics are best used in
    a section like this to either show growth (line graph) or
    percentages of markets or groups (pie chart).

-   **Competition:** All businesses compete in one way or another. It
    may be with specific, direct competitors or it may be with the way
    customers have been doing things for a long time. When identifying
    the competition, identify who else is providing services to solve
    the same problem the business seeks to address. What are the
    business' advantages over these competitors? How will the company's
    voice be heard over the noise of competitors? Sometimes a business
    plan includes a matrix of features and compares how each business
    offers or does not offer those features. This section reflects how
    the company's solution is different and better suited for the
    identified target market compared to the competition.

-   **SWOT analysis:** A SWOT analysis may be included by completing the
    boxes below to assess the business' current environment's strengths
    and weaknesses (internal) and opportunities and threats (external).
    This is a good exercise to go through on an annual basis. After
    completing the analysis, provide thoughts on: how the business'
    strengths can help maximize opportunities and minimize threats; how
    its weaknesses can slow the company's ability to capitalize on the
    opportunities; and how the business' weaknesses could expose it to
    threats.

Operating Plan
==============

Additionally, it is necessary to outline how the company currently and
will continue to develop and maintain a loyal customer base. This
section includes management responsibilities with dates and budgets and
making sure results can be tracked. What are the envisioned phases for
future growth and the capabilities that need to be in place to realize
growth?

The operating plan describes how the business works. Depending on the
type of the business, important elements of this plan should include how
the company will bring services to market and how it will support
customers. It is the logistics, technology, and basic blocking and
tackling of the business.

Depending on the type of business, the following sections may or may not
be necessary. Only include what is needed and remove everything else.
Remember: try to keep the business plan as short as possible. Excessive
detail in this section could easily make the plan too long.

-   **Order fulfillment:** Describe the company's procedures for
    delivering services to its customers. As a service company,
    determine how to keep track of the customer base, form of
    communications, and how best to manage sales and data.

-   **Payment:** Describe the standard payment terms and the payment
    methods accepted. Describe the pricing plans (one-time service fees,
    hourly-based fees, markups, and any other fees) and any impact on
    cash flow.

-   **Technology:** If technology is critical to the business, whether
    it is part of the service offering or is fundamental to delivering a
    service, describe the key technologies used that are proprietary. If
    the business data (company or customer) is at risk, describe the
    data security plan in place, as well as any backup or recovery in
    the case of a disaster or outage.

-   **Key customers:** Identify any customers that are important to the
    success of the business due to a partnership, volume, or pathway to
    a new market. Also identify any customers who bring in more than 10%
    of the company's revenues.

-   **Key employees and organization:** Describe unique skills or
    experiences that are required of the current team. If necessary,
    describe any proprietary recruiting or training processes in place.
    List key employees that are necessary for success. Include an
    organization chart to support this section.

-   **Facilities:** Describe the type of business facility, whether
    leased, owned, or a shared business premises. Provide a listing of
    business locations, their purpose, and future plans for these
    facilities. If there are no facilities, and the business plans to
    buy or lease them, include that in this plan.

Marketing and Sales Plan
========================

Promoting the business, whether through generating leads or traffic to a
website or store, is one of the most important functions of any
business. In this section of the plan, provide details of intended
marketing of the business. Describe the key messages and channels used
for generating leads and promoting the business. This section should
also describe any sales strategy. Depending on the type of business, the
following sections may or may not be necessary. Only include what is
needed and remove everything else.

-   **Key messages:** Describe the key messages that will elevate
    services in the target customers' eyes. If there is sample
    collateral or graphical images of some messages, include them.

-   **Marketing activities:** Which of the following promotion options
    provide the company the best chance of product recognition,
    qualified leads, store traffic, or appointments?

<!-- -->

-   Media advertising (newspaper, magazine, television, radio)

-   Direct mail

-   Telephone solicitation

-   Seminars or business conferences

-   Joint advertising with other companies

-   Word of mouth or fixed signage

-   Digital marketing such as social media, email marketing, SEO, or
    blogging

-   Provide limited free consultations (such as free job pricing for
    Contractors, free landscaping consultation for landscapers, or free
    pricing opinions for real estate agents)

-   Sponsor local sports teams or other community events

-   Give free informational talks either at the business offices or for
    local businesses offering complementary services (such as a real
    estate agent providing seminars about preparing a home to bring to
    market)

-   Do free work for local non-profits (such as an ad agency designing a
    local farmer's market's website for free)

<!-- -->

-   **Sales strategy:** If needed, what will be the sales approach? Will
    there be full-time commissioned sales people, contract sales, or
    another approach? Many one-on-one service businesses are heavily
    reliant on word of mouth. Take this into account when developing the
    sales strategy.

Financial Plan
==============

Creating a financial plan is where all of the business planning comes
together. Up to this point, the target market, target customers, and
pricing have all been identified. These items, along with assumptions,
will help estimate the company's sales forecast. The other side of the
business will be what expenses are expected. This is important on an
ongoing basis to see when the business is profitable. It is also
important to know what expenses will need to be funded before customer
sales, or the cash they generate, is received.

At a minimum, this section should include estimated start-up costs and
projected profit and loss, along with a summary of the assumptions being
made with these projections. Assumptions should include initial and
ongoing sales, along with the timing of these inflows.

-   **Projected start-up costs:** The table below shows a sample of
    ongoing and one-time cost items that the business might need in
    order to open. Many businesses are paid on credit over time and do
    not have cash coming in immediately. It is necessary to make
    assumptions about how many months of recurring items, in addition to
    one-time expenses, to estimate when cash will begin to flow into the
    company. To begin with, the company will have to fund out of savings
    or an initial investment. There is a blank table in the Appendix to
    complete potential start-up cost projections.

  START-UP COSTS

**Projected profit and loss model:** The model below shows a sample of
the projections a small business is forecasting for their first 12
months of operations. The top portion of the table shows projected sales
and gross profit. This is a good place to begin creating the company's
sales forecast. The next section itemizes the recurring expenses the
business is projecting for the same months. These should be consistent
with the estimated start-up costs completed in the prior section. At the
bottom of this model, it will possible to see when the company is
becoming profitable and what expense items are the most impactful to its
profitability. There is a blank table in the Appendix to complete the
business' own start-up cost projections.

Instructions for Getting Started with Estimated Start-Up Costs
--------------------------------------------------------------

Determining a business\' startup costs is critical to ensure enough cash
is available to begin business operations within the budgeted time frame
as well as within the cost budget. Startup costs typically fall within
two categories: monthly costs and one-time costs. Monthly costs cover
costs that occur each month during the startup period, and one-time
costs are costs that will be incurred once during the startup period.

**Steps for preparation:**

-   **Step 1:** Enter the company name and the date this estimate is
    being prepared.

-   **Step 2:** Enter the number of months and the monthly cost for each
    cost item that is recurring. For one-time costs only, skip the
    monthly costs. If there are cost items that have both recurring and
    one-time amounts, enter those as well. The total cost will calculate
    automatically in the far-right column.

-   **Step 3:** Once all of the costs are entered, review the individual
    items and total amount to see where the budget can be fine-tuned or
    move something out into the future when more revenue is coming in.

Instructions for Getting Started on Profit & Loss Projections
-------------------------------------------------------------

Completing projections for Profit and Loss of a new company is a good
exercise to understand and communicate when the company will begin to
break even and see how sales and profits will grow. The top portion of
the model to the left, Revenue, is a good way to forecast sales, month
by month for the first year. The lower portion then applies estimated
expenses for the same period of time to derive the business\'
profitability.

**Steps for preparation:**

-   **Step 1:** Enter the company name and the date this projection is
    being prepared.

-   **Step 2:** For each month, beginning in January or whenever the
    start is estimated, enter the expected sales to be. This could be
    for a single service or multiple services. Add lines to this model
    for additional offerings. From this, subtract any product returns or
    discounts that are to be tracked (these should be shown as negative
    numbers, for example, -10). Below Net Sales, enter the Cost of Goods
    Sold. This refers to the monetized value of the time spent on a
    particular client.

-   **Step 3:** For each month, enter the estimated salaries, marketing,
    utilities, and other items that are projected.

-   **Step 4:** Once all of the costs have been entered, review the
    individual items and total amount to see where projections can be
    fine-tuned or move something out into the future when more revenue
    is coming in. The objective is to get to profitability and positive
    cash flow as quickly as possible.
